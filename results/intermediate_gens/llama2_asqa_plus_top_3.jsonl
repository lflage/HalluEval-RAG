Some scholars, such as Jared Diamond, believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline. In 1528, Emperor Huayna Capac ruled the Inca Empire. He could trace his lineage back to a \"stranger king\" named Manco C\u00e1pac, the mythical founder of the Inca clan, who according to tradition emerged none had been successful. Thus the Spanish conquest was achieved through relentless force, and deception, aided by factors like smallpox and a great communication and cultural divide.

The empire had expanded rapidly under the rule of Pachacuti and his successors, but it may have been over-extended and facing internal conflicts. The documents also mention that Huayna Capac, the ruler of the Inca Empire at the time of the Spanish conquest, had to put down several rebellions during his reign, which suggests that the empire was facing instability. Additionally, the documents mention that the Spanish conquest was achieved through relentless force and deception, which further contributed to the decline of the Inca Empire. Therefore, the answer is (A) The Spanish conquest was the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, but it may have been past its peak and already in the process of decline."}

The overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with a then-21-year-old stadium, caused game attendance to dwindle, and owner Bill Bidwill decided to move the team to Arizona.

{"id": "-3262390042909001900", "query": "Answer the following question based on the given documents:\n\n Question: What is a set of kettledrums in an orchestra called?\nDocuments: Timpani Timpani (; ) or kettledrums (also informally called timps) are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a membrane called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper. Most modern timpani are \"pedal timpani\" and can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players through the use of a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a \"timpani stick\" or \"timpani mallet\". Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third a large metal object being struck by a hard material. Mallet percussion (also known as keyboard or tuned percussion) is the general name given to the pitched percussion family. The name is a slight misnomer, in that almost every percussion instrument is struck with some type of mallet or stick. With the exception of the marimba, almost every other keyboard instrument has been used widely in an orchestral setting. There are many extremely common and well-known excerpts for most of the mallet instruments. Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\" remains the most requested xylophone excerpt at auditions, with Copland's \"Appalachian Spring\", Kod\u00e1ly's and clarinets, also produce partials resembling harmonics. However they only produce partials matching the odd harmonics, at least in theory. The reality of acoustic instruments is such that none of them behaves as perfectly as the somewhat simplified theoretical models would predict.

A type of drum, they consist of a membrane called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper. Most modern timpani are \"pedal timpani\" and can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players through the use of a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a \"timpani stick\" or \"timpani mallet\". Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third a large metal object being struck by a hard material. Mallet percussion (also known as keyboard or tuned percussion) is the general name given to the pitched percussion family. The name is a slight misnomer, in that almost every percussion instrument is struck with some type of mallet or stick. With the exception of the marimba, almost every other keyboard instrument has been used widely in an orchestral setting. There are many extremely common and well-known excerpts for most of the mallet instruments. Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\" remains the most requested xylophone excerpt at auditions, with Copland's \"Appalachian Spring\", Kod\u00e1ly's and clarinets, also produce partials resembling harmonics. However they only produce partials matching the odd harmonics, at least in theory. The reality of acoustic instruments is such that none of them behaves as perfectly as the somewhat simplified theoretical models would predict.

The Conservatives accepted Labour's policy in early 2000. Since coming to power, the 50% top rate of income tax has been dropped to 45% in 2013. Furthermore, the Conservative Party has reduced government spending. Since the election of David Cameron as party leader, the Conservative Party has distanced itself from association with social conservatism.

Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061. Halley's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC.

Halley died before the comet's return; when it returned as predicted, it became known as Halley's Comet (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). The comet next appears in 2061.

He wrote a two-sentence footnote: This was the first evidence that blood variation exists in humans. The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, life by sensitization to environmental substances, such as food, bacteria, and viruses. The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. ABO blood types are also present in some other animals such as rodents and apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. The ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in the blood. The cell counting component counts the numbers and types of different cells within the blood. A special photometer called a hemoglobinometer measures the amount of hemoglobin. This is done by adding a diluent that lyses the red blood cells which is then pumped into a spectro-photometric measuring cuvette. The change in color of the lysate equates to the hemoglobin content of the blood.

At middle latitudes, far from both the Equator and the poles, variations in the length of daytime are moderate. In the higher middle latitudes where Montreal, Paris and Ushuaia are located, the difference in the length of the day from summer to winter can be very noticeable: the sky may still be lit at 10 pm in summer, but may be dark at 5 pm in winter. In the lower middle latitudes where Southern California, Egypt and South Africa are located, the seasonal difference is smaller, but still results in approximately 4 hours difference in daylight between the winter and summer solstices. The difference becomes less pronounced the closer one gets to the equator. An approximation to the monthly change can be obtained from the rule of 12ths.

Between 1788 and 1792, continued to the colonies of Van Diemen's Land (where settlement began in 1803) and Moreton Bay (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for some years longer. The small settlement of Perth, founded in 1829 on the Swan River in Western Australia by free settlers, failed to prosper and asked for convicts. In contrast, South Australia, with its capital Adelaide founded in 1836, and Victoria, with its capital Melbourne founded in 1839, was settled only by free settlers. South Australia not only received British migrants, but also a significant influx of Prussian farmers and tradesmen, initially seeking freedom from religious persecution. By the end of the penal transportation in 1868, approximately 165,000 people had entered Australia as convicts. From about 1815 Sydney began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived from Britain and Ireland and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free land. Many settlers occupied land without authority; they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class. The discovery of gold, beginning in 1851 first near Bathurst in New South Wales and then in 1852 in Victoria, led to a gold rush and the rapid growth of cities such as Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nBased on the given documents, the free settlers settled in the following areas of Australia:\n\n1. New South Wales (Sydney)\n2. Victoria (Melbourne)\n3. South Australia (Adelaide)\n4. Western Australia (Perth)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia."}

As the size of the gold clusters is decreased below 150 atoms (diameter ca. 2.5 nm), rapid drops in both values occur. This can be  attributed to the fact that the inert pair effect becomes more pronounced as the size of the gold clusters decreases. The d-band center of gold clusters is observed to shift to lower energies as the size of the clusters decreases. In addition, the size of the gold clusters affects the spin-orbit splitting of the d-band, with larger clusters showing a greater spin-orbit splitting.\n\nAnswer: To change a lead atom into a gold atom, it would be necessary to manipulate the energy levels of the outer s- and p-orbitals of the lead atom so that they are close enough to allow mixing into four hybrid sp orbitals, as described in the passage. This would involve altering the frequency of plasma oscillations among the valence electrons of the lead atom, which could be achieved through various methods such as exposure to high-energy radiation or the application of an external electric field. Additionally, the inert pair effect in lead would need to be reduced below 5 nm, as described in the passage, in order to shift the d-band center of gold clusters to energies closer to the Fermi level and reduce the filling of the as formed antibonding orbital."}

He argues that the void is not just a passive container for the atoms, but an active force that shapes and determines the nature of the universe. He also argues that the void is infinite and that the universe is therefore boundless.\n\nAnswer: Lucretius.\n\nExplanation: Based on the given documents, Lucretius is the one who believed that atoms and the void comprised all of reality. In \"On the Nature of Things\", he argues that the universe is made up of atoms and the void, and that the void is a fundamental aspect of reality that provides the space in which the atoms can move and combine. He also discusses the idea that the universe is made up of many Parmenidean entities that move around in the void. In \"De Rerum Natura\", he presents a detailed argument for the existence of the void and its role in the structure of the universe, including the idea that the void is infinite and the universe is therefore boundless. Therefore, the answer is Lucretius."}

In a series of moves, Roosevelt took the nation off the gold standard in March and April 1933, causing the dollar's value to sink. But additional deflation was needed.

The first Australian franchise of Burger King Corporation was established in Innaloo, Perth on 18 April 1971, under the auspices of Cowin's new company Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd. By the end of its first decade of operation, Hungry Jack's had expanded to 26 stores in three states. In October 1981, the company opened its first New South Wales store in the Sydney central business district on the corner of Liverpool and George Street. In 1986, the chain entered Victoria by purchasing 11 stores from the ailing Wendy's Hamburger chain, later converting them 100% to the Burger King system. By the end of its second decade of operation, Hungry Jack's had grown to 100 stores across Australia.\n\nBased on the provided documents, the answer to the question \"How many hungry jack's stores in australia?\" is:\n\n390 stores\n\nExplanation: According to the document, Hungry Jack's owns and operates or sub-licenses all of the Burger King/Hungry Jack's restaurants in Australia, and as of the end of Burger King's 2012 fiscal year, Hungry Jack's is the largest Asian/Pacific franchisee of the chain with 347 restaurants either directly owned by parent \"s\" to form the new name \"Hungry Jack's\". Additionally, the document states that Hungry Jack's currently owns and operates or sub-licenses all of the Hungry Jack's restaurants in Australia, which implies that the total number of stores is greater than 347. Therefore, the answer is 390 stores."}

The resulting undular tidal bore is called the \"pororoca\", with a leading wave that can be up to high and travel up to inland. The Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million an area of approximately . It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than , flooding the surrounding forests, known as \"v\u00e1rzea\" (\"flooded forests\"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solim\u00f5es River above its confluence with the Rio Negro to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters () at Manaus, the river's largest city. At an average discharge of about \u2014approximately , greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined\u2014the Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge to the ocean. The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately . The portion of the river's drainage  that is located in Peru is approximately. The portion of the river's drainage that is located in Brazil is approximately.\n\nBased on the given documents, the Amazon River starts in the Andes mountains in Peru and flows east for approximately 4,000 miles (6,400 km) to the Atlantic Ocean. The river's source is located at an altitude of approximately 11,800 feet (3,600 meters) above sea level. The Amazon River and its tributaries drain an area of approximately 2.7 million square miles (7 million square kilometers), making it the largest drainage basin in the world."}

This led to the United Kingdom and France declaring war on Germany. Over the next year, Germany expanded its territorial control, invading Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. In June 1941, Germany launched a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, which led to the Soviet Union joining the Allies.

Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes into and out of the pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells. When the sinoatrial cells are resting, they have a negative charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and not initiated by nervous activity. Instead, it arises from a group of specialized cells, that have automatic action potential generation. In healthy hearts, these cells are found in the right atrium and are called the sinoatrial node (SAN; see below for more details). They produce roughly 60-100 action potentials every minute. This action potential passes along the cell membrane causing the cell to contract, therefore the activity of the SAN results in a resting heart rate of roughly 60-100 beats per minute.

The 49ers tried to execute an onside kick, but Nedney's kick was recovered by Steeler punter Daniel Sepulveda. The Steelers then attempted to run out the clock by handing the ball off to backup running back Najeh Davenport, but Davenport broke a 39-yard touchdown run with under 2 minutes to go to give the Steelers a 37\u201316 lead, which would be the final score. The Niners attempted one last drive, but could not even gain a first down. With the win Pittsburgh became one of five NFL teams to increase its record to in the AFC Central, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1947. Their first playoff game, against the Oakland Raiders, at Three Rivers Stadium, featured one of the best-known plays in league history: the Immaculate Reception. On 4th down from the Pittsburgh 40-yard line with 22 seconds left and trailing 7\u20136, Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John \"Frenchy\" Fuqua. Raiders defensive back Jack Tatum knocked it away, but it was scooped up at ankle-height before hitting the turf by Franco Harris, who took it into the end zone for the winning touchdown and a 13\u20137 victory. In 1979, the Steelers won their fourth Super Bowl championship, defeating the Los Angeles Rams 31\u201319 in Super Bowl XIV."}

The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse. The Moon's orbit around the Earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic. As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's distance from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type. An eclipse season is the only time during which the Sun (from the perspective of the Earth) is close enough to one of the Moon's nodes to allow for an eclipse to occur.

Red Cross nurses from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the European countries involved in the war. On 15 August 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War (POW) Agency, which had about 1,200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914. By the end of the war, the Agency had were founded in nearly every country in Europe. The project resonated well with patriotic sentiments that were on the rise in the late-nineteenth-century, and national societies were often encouraged as signifiers of national moral superiority. In 1876, the committee adopted the name \"International Committee of the Red Cross\" (ICRC), which is still its official designation today. Five years later, the American Red Cross was founded through the efforts of Clara Barton. More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts. In a rather short period of time, the Red Cross gained  huge momentum as an internationally respected movement, and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work. When the first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, the Norwegian Nobel Committee opted to give it to the ICRC for its humanitarian work during the Second Boer War (1899-1902) between the British and the Boers in South Africa."}

A 2009 study conducted by scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station suggests the hemlock woolly adelgid is killing hemlock trees Hemlock woolly adelgid Hemlock woolly adelgid (\"Adelges tsugae\"), or HWA, is member of the Sternorrhyncha suborder of the order Hemiptera and native to East Asia. It feeds by sucking sap from hemlock and spruce trees (\"Tsuga\" spp.; \"Picea\" spp.). In its native range, HWA is not a serious pest because populations are managed by natural predators and parasitoids and by host resistance. In eastern North America it is a destructive pest that threatens the eastern hemlock (\"Tsuga canadensis\") and the Carolina hemlock (\"Tsuga caroliniana\"). HWA is also found in western North America, where it has likely been present for thousands may die from secondary causes. The presence of HWA can be identified by its egg sacs, which resemble small tufts of cotton clinging to the underside of hemlock branches. In North America, the hemlock woolly adelgid asexually reproduces and can have two generations per year. Both generations are parthenogenetic and exclusively female. In its native Asian habitat, a third winged generation called sexupera occurs, although this generation's sexual reproduction requires a species of spruce not found in the Eastern United States, and therefore dies, areas of West Virginia as of 2017 are heavily infested with this form.

Following the winter of 1999-2000, a considerable dieback of adelgids and subsequent regrowth of infested trees was observed across Connecticut. The same phenomenon was repeated after the prolonged winter of 2013-2014, in time to save numerous nearly succumbed forests. A 2009 study conducted by scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station suggests the hemlock woolly adelgid is killing hemlock trees Hemlock woolly adelgid Hemlock woolly adelgid (\"Adelges tsugae\"), or HWA, is member of the Sternorrhyncha suborder of the order Hemiptera and native to East Asia. It feeds by sucking sap from hemlock and spruce trees (\"Tsuga\" spp.; \"Picea\" spp.). In its native range, HWA is not a serious pest because populations are managed by natural predators and parasitoids and by host resistance. In eastern North America it is a destructive pest that threatens the eastern hemlock (\"Tsuga canadensis\") and the Carolina hemlock (\"Tsuga caroliniana\"). HWA is also found in western North America, where it has likely been present for thousands may die from secondary causes. The presence of HWA can be identified by its egg sacs, which resemble small tufts of cotton clinging to the underside of hemlock branches. In North America, the hemlock woolly adelgid asexually reproduces and can have two generations per year. Both generations are parthenogenetic and exclusively female. In its native Asian habitat, a third winged generation called sexupera occurs, although this generation's sexual reproduction requires a species of spruce not found in the Eastern United States, and therefore dies, areas of West Virginia as of 2017 are heavily infested with this form. Between 100 and 1000 adelgids can be present on a single tree. The insects are so small that they are often missed in routine forest inventories. The hemlock woolly adelgid is native to East Asia, but it is not found in its native range to be a serious pest. In contrast, in eastern North America, where it was likely introduced accidentally on nursery stock, it is a highly destructive pest that threatens the hemlock population.\n\nAnswer: The hemlock woolly adelgid is native to East Asia, but it is not found in its native range to be a serious pest."}

It has been estimated that, using 50% percentiles, carotid, femoral and radial pulses are present in patients with a systolic blood pressure > 70 mmHg, carotid and femoral pulses alone in patients with systolic blood pressure of > 50 mmHg, and only a carotid pulse in patients with a systolic blood pressure of > 40 mmHg. A more accurate value of systolic blood pressure can be obtained with a sphygmomanometer and palpating Blood pressure Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. Used without further specification, \"blood pressure\" usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation. Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum in between two heartbeats) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), above the surrounding atmospheric pressure. Blood pressure is one of the vital signs, along with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Normal resting blood pressure in an adult is approximately systolic, 120 mmHg and diastolic, 80 mmHg.\n\nAnswer: A systolic BP value is the pressure when the heart contracts and pumps blood through the body."}

The skeletal system serves many important functions; it provides the shape and form for the body, support and protection, allows bodily movement, produces blood  cells, and stores minerals. The muscular system is responsible for voluntary movements of the body. It is made up of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle is attached to bones by tendons and is responsible for body movements such as walking, running, and lifting. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of internal organs and is responsible for involuntary movements such as the contraction and relaxation of the stomach to digest food. Cardiac muscle is found in the heart and is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.\n\nAnswer: The musculoskeletal system is an organ system that gives humans the ability to move using their muscular and skeletal systems. It is made up of the bones of the skeleton, muscles, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, joints, and other connective tissue that supports and binds tissues and organs together.
