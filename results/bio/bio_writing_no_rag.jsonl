He also signed the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery throughout the United States.\n\nLincoln was a skilled leader and orator, and he is remembered for his eloquence and his commitment to freedom and equality. He is often quoted as saying, \"Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\n\nTragically, Lincoln's life was cut short by an assassin's bullet.
