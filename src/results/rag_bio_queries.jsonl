She is known for her acting in such films as 1993 American crime drama film \"A Bronx Tale\" and her singing in such work as her 1997 debut studio album \"This Time\" which peaked at #4 on \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. Hicks co-starred in the musical stage play Tyler Perry's \"Aunt Bam's Place\" with Paris Bennett, Cassi Davis, Jeffrey Lewis, and Melonie Daniels. It had a 3-day run beginning August 30, 2011 in Atlanta, GA (Cobb Energy Center) and was filmed for a DVD release on June 12, 2012. Hicks began her film career with a role alongside Robert De Niro in the 1993 film, \"A Bronx Tale\". Her subsequent film roles were small: 1995's \"Just Cause\" with Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne, and 1996's \"Educating Matt Waters\" and \"The Preacher's Wife\" with Whitney Houston. She appeared in the movie \"Belly\" in 1998. In 2000, she appeared on screen in the short film, \"Are You Cinderella?\", with actor Wood Harris. Her later film roles were in independent films such as 2005's \"The Salon\", with Vivica A. Fox, Dondre Whitfield, Math\". In 1995, Hicks signed a deal with Motown Records and released an album titled \"This Time\". The single \"Ooh, Ooh Baby\", written by and featuring Missy Elliott, charted on the Billboard R&B singles chart. However, the lead single intended to debut her singing career was \"Distant Lover\", an uptempo track produced by Teddy Riley.
