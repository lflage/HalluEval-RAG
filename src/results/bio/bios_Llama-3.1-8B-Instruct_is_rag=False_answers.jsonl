The child, later named Gerardo, was reportedly healthy and developed normally.\n\nMedina's pregnancy was extensively studied by medical professionals, who were unable to explain the cause of her pregnancy. Various theories were proposed, including rape, incest, or a tumor, but none were confirmed.\n\nMedina's case was documented in the medical literature, and she was studied by several prominent medical experts of the time.
