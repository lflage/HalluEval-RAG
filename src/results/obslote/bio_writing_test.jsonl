Born on October 27, 1945, in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, Lula grew up in a poor household and was forced to drop out of school in the fourth grade to work in a shoe factory to support his family.\n\nLula became involved in politics at a young age, joining the Workers' Party (PT) in 1975. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the party's leader in 1980. In 1986, he was elected to the Brazilian Congress, where he remained until 1990.\n\nLula's political career took a major turn in 1994, when he ran for President of Brazil against incumbent Fernando Collor de Mello. Although Collor was initially favored to win, Lula's campaign gained momentum after he was arrested on corruption charges in 1992. Despite being acquitted, the scandal damaged Collor's reputation, and Lula went on to win the election in 1994.\n\nAs President, Lula focused on reducing poverty and inequality in Brazil. He implemented a series of social programs, including the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, which provided cash transfers to poor families who kept their children in school and received regular health check-ups. He also increased investment in education and healthcare, and implemented policies to promote economic growth and reduce inflation.\n\nLula's presidency was marked by several major achievements, including the discovery of large oil reserves in the deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean, which helped to fuel Brazil's economic growth. He also played a key role in the creation of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) grouping of emerging economies, which sought to promote cooperation and mutual understanding between the member countries.\n\nLula was re-elected in 2006, defeating candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra in the second round of voting. However, his second term was marred by corruption scandals and allegations of authoritarianism. In 2011, he was succeeded by Dilma Rousseff, who was his former Chief of Staff and a fellow member of the Workers' Party.\n\nSince leaving office, Lula has remained a prominent figure in Brazilian politics. He was convicted of corruption and money laundering in 2017 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. However, his conviction was later upheld by an appeals court, and he is currently serving a 17-year prison sentence. Despite his legal troubles, Lula remains a popular figure among many Brazilians, who see him as a champion of the poor and a symbol of hope for a more equal society."}
